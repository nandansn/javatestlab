 * 
 *         Collections in java is a framework that provides an architecture to
 *         store and manipulate the group of objects.
 * 
 *         All the operations that you perform on a data such as searching,
 *         sorting, insertion, manipulation, deletion etc. can be performed by
 *         Java Collections.
 * 
 *         The Iterable interface (java.lang.Iterable) is one of the root
 *         interfaces of the Java collection classes. The Collection interface
 *         extends Iterable, so all subtypes of Collection also implement the
 *         Iterable interface.
 * 
 *

/*
 * Traverse  print all the array elements one by one.
 * 
 * Insertion  Adds an element at the given index.
 * 
 * Deletion  Deletes an element at the given index.
 * 
 * Search Searches an element using the given index or by the value.
 * 
 * Update  Updates an element at the given index.
