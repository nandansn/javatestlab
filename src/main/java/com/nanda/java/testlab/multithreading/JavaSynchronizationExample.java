 *         Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of
 *         multiple threads to any shared resource.
 * 
 *         Java Synchronization is better option where we want to allow only one
 *         thread to access the shared resource.
 * 
 *         Why use Synchronization
 * 
 *         The synchronization is mainly used to
 * 
 *         To prevent thread interference. To prevent consistency problem
 * 
 *         Types of Synchronization
 * 
 *         There are two types of synchronization
 * 
 *         Process Synchronization Thread Synchronization
 * 
 *         Thread Synchronization
 * 
 *         There are two types of thread synchronization mutual exclusive and
 *         inter-thread communication.
 * 
 *         Mutual Exclusive Synchronized method. Synchronized block. static
 *         synchronization.
 * 
 *         Cooperation (Inter-thread communication in java)
 * 
 *         Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the lock
 *         or monitor. Every object has an lock associated with it. By
 *         convention, a thread that needs consistent access to an object's
 *         fields has to acquire the object's lock before accessing them, and
 *         then release the lock when it's done with them.
