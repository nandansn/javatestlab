 *         If any thread is in sleeping or waiting state (i.e. sleep() or wait()
 *         is invoked), calling the interrupt() method on the thread, breaks out
 *         the sleeping or waiting state throwing InterruptedException. If the
 *         thread is not in the sleeping or waiting state, calling the
 *         interrupt() method performs normal behaviour and doesn't interrupt
 *         the thread but sets the interrupt flag to true. Let's first see the
 *         methods provided by the Thread class for thread interruption.
